## 0. Udemy Script Arranging Period [Aug-20-23]

<p>If you watch Udemy online videos by 'Auto-generated English' caption,</br>
then you will see the period of the sentence is not on the same line of the sentence.
Like below screenshot.</p>

<p>
This C program arranges the period at the right position of sentences.
It will be useful to translate the auto-generated script to your language.
For example, I translate a script to Korean by DeepL PC version.
