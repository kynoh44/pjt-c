We can use these curly braces to print out the value of a variable, but there's another use of the

curly braces that we're going to see very often, and that is to write out an expression directly inside

of our jar.

Let me show you what I mean by that.

If I wanted to print out the current time on the screen, I could maybe create a date object.

By calling new date, I can then get the current time by running date dot to locale time string.

Notice that this says locale right here.

So there's an end in me.

There's an E on the end of the word.

So it's not just local, it's locale with the E right there.

If I then print out time.

I'll get the time of ten 4919, which is my current time.

Now, if I use this approach, I end up having to write a lot of extra code in my component.

If I wanted to, I could condense this all down just a little bit by figuring out the current time entirely

within these curly braces.

So let me show you an alternative way of writing all this out, rather than declaring the two variables

ahead of time inside those curly braces.

I'm going to add in a new date object.

I'll then call to locale time string directly on it.

Now, when I save this, my code formatter might automatically reformat it.

Looks like it's not.

But if I do save it, my screen refreshes over here, and you'll notice I still get the exact same result.

So we don't always have to declare a variable ahead of time and then reference that variable inside

of our JSX.

We do it very often just to keep our components a little bit clean.

But in many other cases, we might decide that it's just a little bit easier or more clear to write

out what we want to print directly inside the curly braces.

It's completely up to you as a developer on which approach you're going to take and you're going to

develop a better sense of which is more appropriate over time.
